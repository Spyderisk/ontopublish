# List of Ontopublish copyright licensors/owners

Every individual and organisation listed here has chosen to license their work
to the world under Open Source terms and conditions. We have incorporated that
work into Ontopublish. Thank you.

If you feel you should be listed here but are not, then please
[do get in touch](mailto://team@spyderisk.org).

Each owner/licensor is listed with an indication of at least one of their
contributions, however, this is not intended to be authoritative or exhaustive.
Refer to the Ontopublish source tree for exact details.  

Note: some authors are not listed here because their employment contracts mean they are not Owners. They deserve just as much
recognition, and are listed in [CONTRIBUTORS.md](./CONTRIBUTORS.md).
