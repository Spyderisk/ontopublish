# List of Ontopublish contributors

"Contributors" refers to individual people whose work appears in Ontopublish. There are
two kinds of individual contributors:

1. Those listed in the [LICENSORS file](./LICENSORS.md), because as owners
they have the right to license their work as open source.

2. Those who are listed in this file, who cannot be licensors because they do not own
the code they have contributed, because their employer of the day owns the code instead.

If you feel you should be listed here but are not, then please [send us an email](mailto://team@spyderisk.org). You can also
contact us on the [spyderisk-dev mailing list](mailto://spyderisk-dev@jiscmail.ac.uk), which has [archives
online](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?A0=SPYDERISK-DEV).
