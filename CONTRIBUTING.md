# Contributing to the Ontology Publishing Project

Welcome!

We'd love to have your contributions to the Ontology Publishing Project, initially developed for
[Spyderisk](https://github.com/Spyderisk/). This document is about our practical principles of working. 

Please read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and
respectful.

# Who can contribute?

We are looking for help from:

* semantic web specialists (do you know about knowledge graphs?)
* container specification and deployment experts (we just want to get this up and running reproducibly)
* web application experts (have you got something better than ontospy you know well?)

# How to open a query or bug report

* Open a [new issue in ontopublish](https://github.com/Spyderisk/ontopublish/issues/new)
* Select the template marked "New Ontopublish query". 

# How to submit a patch

Fixes for code or documentation are welcome, on GitHub or elsewhere.

Either:

* [create a GitHub fork and send a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
* put up your non-GitHub tree and send us the URL 

But basically just talk to us using whatever means you are comfortable with.

# Spyderisk project principles

## Openness first

* Our software licensing is Apache 2, and analogously for documentation
* Our communication is collaborative and collective
* We build our software around openly published academic theory
