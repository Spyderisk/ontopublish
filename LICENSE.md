# Short summary

Ontopublish is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, with documentation under Creative Commons, and any other licenses as
required by open source projects we reuse.

The site [TL;DR Legal](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2-0-apache-2-0)
summarises the Apache license as:
> You can do what you like with the software, as long as you include the required notices.
> This permissive license contains a patent license from the contributors of the code.

For most people most of the time, this is all you need to know - please use and enjoy Ontopublish!

We mostly use the [SPDX software component descriptors](https://spdx.dev/), which is a
Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) system. These are just a particular format for
headers of source files, and a template is given in the [LICENCES directory](./LICENSES/README.md).

Ontopublish documentation is generally under a Creative Commons license, again
explained in detail in [LICENSES](LICENSES/README.md).

# Licensor or Contributor?

The distinction matters legally, but in the day-to-day we just want to acknowledge the work done. Only someone who owns code
has the right to license that code. Some contributors' employers own their contributions, and therefore they cannot be a
licensor.

# No CLA

As a matter of policy, Ontopublish does not and will not have a Contributor License Agreement (CLA),
for reaons similar to [Red Hat](https://opensource.com/article/19/2/cla-problems),
the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2014/jun/09/do-not-need-cla/) and
other leading open source voices. 

Ontopublish adheres to the "inbound = outbound" principle, where Licensors get
exactly the same rights as anyone else in the world. While we use the credible
Apache 2 license from [apache.org](https://apache.org), Ontopublish is not
affiliated with apache.org, and we do not use the Apache CLAs or other tools
which do not share rights equally with all.
